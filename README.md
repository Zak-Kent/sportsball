## Examples

## Configuration

The configuration is specified in the project's `config.edn` file. Each top
level key in config map corresponds to a logical component in the app.
Dependencies between these components are expressed using the `#ig/ref` tag.
E.g. if a component map has an entry like `:app/bar {:foo-dep #ig/reg :app/foo}`
it means that the `:app/bar` component is dependent on `:app/foo`. Below is an
example of the app config, namespaced keys are used to indicate where the various
components are found throughout the app.

```
{:storage/db {:dbtype "postgres"
              :user <user>
              :port <port>
              :password <pass>
              :dbname "sportsball"}

 :slack/conn-info {:url <required-env-var: SPORTSBALL_SLACK_POST_URL_FILE>
                   :bot-token <required-env-var: SPORTSBALL_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN>
                   :channel "sports"}

 :app/logging {<required-env-var: SPORTSBALL_LOG_FILE>}

 :app/config {:alert-registry nil
              :db #ig/ref :storage/db
              :slack-conn-info #ig/ref :slack/conn-info}

 :app/routes {:config #ig/ref :app/config}

 :app/jetty {:jetty-conf {:port 3000 :join? false}
             :app-routes #ig/ref :app/routes}

 :app/task-scheduler {:core-threads 4}

 :app/scraper {:scheduler #ig/ref :app/task-scheduler
               :config #ig/ref :app/config
               :scrape-interval #or [#env SPORTSBALL_SCRAPE_INTERVAL_MINS 5]}}
```
The [Aero](https://github.com/juxt/aero) library is used when parsing the config.
Aero uses tagged literals to customize the behavior when parsing different config
elements. Examples of custom defined tags specific to this app can be found in
`src/sporsball/config.clj`.

Once the config is loaded it's passed to [Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant) a lifecycle management
library which then initializes the various app components described in the config
taking the order of dependencies into account.
