Read on to learn more about <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/">betting odds</a>, how to choose a great MLB sportsbook, and the different wagering options available to you.&nbsp;<br>If you are also interested in betting on other major leagues, visit our <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/">NFL Odds</a>, <a href="/picks/nfl/">NFL Picks</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nba-basketball/">NBA Odds</a> sites now. For all other betting odds please check out our <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/">Betting Odds</a> page.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2><strong>Best Sportsbooks for Baseball</strong></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><div>The vast majority of online sportsbooks offer MLB odds. However, you should only set up an account at safe, secure, trustworthy sites that have a long history of paying customers out on time. There are a number of shady operators that will try to scam you, so stick to the sites listed on our <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/best-sportsbooks/">best online sportsbooks</a> page, such as Caesars and Tipico.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2><strong>MLB Moneyline Betting</strong></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><div>This is a <strong>straightforward bet on which team will win a particular game</strong>. The sportsbooks will calculate the probability of each team securing victory, and assign odds accordingly. One team is usually installed as the favorite and the other is the underdog team.&nbsp;<br>Let’s say the Dodgers are playing the White Sox in LA. You might see -150 on the Dodgers winning the game, and +130 on the White Sox. If you see a <strong>minus symbol</strong>, it tells you the amount you need to wager to generate a $100 profit. You would have to lay down $150 on the Dodgers at -150 to win $100.&nbsp;<br>A <strong>plus sign</strong> tells you the amount you stand to win from a $100 bet. If you bet $100 on the White Sox at odds of +130, you would earn a $130 profit if they won the game. In this instance, a $20 bet on the Dodgers at -150 would earn you $13.33, whereas a $20 bet on the White Sox at +130 would earn you $26. That tells you the Dodgers are the favorites, and the White Sox are the underdogs.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2><strong>MLB Run Line</strong></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><div>This is an interesting baseball spread betting option. It gives the supposedly stronger team a <strong>-1.5 run handicap</strong> in order to skew the odds. Sticking with the above example, the Dodgers would be given the -1.5 run handicap. If you bet on them to cover the run line, they would have to win the game by 2 or more runs. If they only won by a single run, your bet would crash and burn. However, you would expect a price of +110. A $20 wager would therefore net you $22 as opposed to $13.33, making it more lucrative.&nbsp;<br>The alternative would be to bet on the White Sox +1.5. If the White Sox either won the game or lost by a single run, your bet would pay out. However, you would expect to receive odds of -130 instead of +130. You would therefore receive a smaller payout, but it gives you a greater chance of success. <strong>A run line bet is essentially a baseball point spread</strong>. If you hear fans talking about MLB spreads, they are generally referring to the run line.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2><strong>MLB Totals</strong></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><div>This is a popular form of baseball gambling. You do not have to specify which team will win a particular game. Instead you must decide if there will be lots of runs, or if it will be a low-scoring clash. The sportsbooks will set a <strong>total runs line</strong> and you must predict whether the cumulative runs scored by both teams will go <strong>over that number</strong>, or <strong>stay under it</strong>. You will generally find a price of -110 on over and -110 on under in this MLB line. Then simply make your <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/mlb/">MLB predictions</a> and enjoy the game.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2><strong>MLB Futures Betting</strong></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><div>Before a new season begins, oddsmakers at the leading <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/best-sportsbooks/">sportsbooks</a> will assess the strengths and weaknesses of each team. They will then assign odds on each team winning the World Series. It starts with a favorite and then goes all the way down to the complete outsider. These <strong>futures betting lines shift over the course of the season</strong>, depending on how well each team is playing. &nbsp;<br>You will also find futures options on the winner of the American League, the National League and each individual division. There are <strong>futures wagers</strong> available on player markets too, such as the Cy Young Award, the MVP and Rookie of the Year in each league, most saves, most steals, most runs, most strikeouts and so on.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2><strong>MLB Parlays</strong></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><div>A parlay bet allows you to roll a number of <strong>different selections into one wager</strong> in order to generate a larger potential payout. You might think the Padres, the White Sox and the Twins will all win on a particular evening. Instead of dividing your bankroll into three and betting on each team individually, you can put them together for a parlay.&nbsp;<br>All three must win in order for your bet to pay out, but if they all secure victory you will be in line for a large payout, larger than if you had placed three individual bets. You can combine moneyline, run line and totals bets for parlays.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>What does -110 mean?</strong></h3><div>It tells you that you will need to place a $110 bet in order to make a $10 profit. You will often see -110 on over and -110 on under in the baseball lines on totals. It means you win a $9.10 profit from a $10 bet on either outcome. That allows the <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/best-sportsbooks/">sportsbook</a> to make a margin on both sides of the MLB betting lines. Some offer -105 instead of -110. They are known as reduced juice MLB lines.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>What does +1.5 mean in baseball?</strong></h3><div>That refers to the run line. It gives the supposedly weaker team a +1.5 run head start in a game. If you decide to back that team to cover the run line, it must either win the game or only lose by a single run in order for your bet to pay out.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>How do you win a bet in baseball?</strong></h3><div>Check the MLB daily line and find something that appeals to you. Make sure you do plenty of research before placing a bet, factoring in the head-to-head records between the teams, injury concerns, motivation levels, home advantage, fatigue and so on. You might also like to check out some experts’ <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/mlb/">MLB picks</a>. Then choose a team to win on the moneyline or the run line, or opt for a totals bet, a prop bet or a parlay. Choose your stake and place a bet. If your prediction is successful, you will generate a profit and your account will be credited. Try not to simply bet on your favorite team to win. A Mets baseball fan might decide to back his team each week, but you need to bet with your head rather than your heart.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>What is the line in baseball betting?</strong></h3><div>This is a common question for anyone that wants baseball odds explained. It refers to the run line, which gives the favorite a 1.5 run handicap. If you bet on that team to cover the line, it must win by 2 or more runs. The Las Vegas MLB lines are always eagerly anticipated, as Las Vegas MLB odds often set the trends for other <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/best-sportsbooks/">sportsbooks</a>.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>What is the moneyline in baseball?</strong></h3><div>This is a simple wager on the team that will win a particular game. Oddsmakers set a price for each team based on head-to-head records, the caliber of the roster and how well they are playing. You then choose which team you think will win and bet on it to cover the moneyline.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>What does a +200 moneyline mean?</strong></h3><div>This means you will earn $200 in profit for every $100 you wager if that prediction turns out to be correct. Your stake is also returned if your bet wins, so you would be handed back $300.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>What is the runline?</strong></h3><div>The runline is a handicap spread that gives the weaker team a 1.5 run head start in order to skew the odds.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>Are there spreads in baseball?</strong></h3><div>The run line is a form of spread bet. However, baseball is a much lower scoring game than football or basketball, so <strong>you will not find a large point spread</strong>, with odds of -110 on either outcome.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>How to read baseball betting lines?</strong></h3><div>If it starts with a plus symbol, it tells you how much you will win from a $100 stake. If the line starts with a minus, it informs you of the amount you need to wager to earn a $100 profit. You might see decimal or fractional lines, but you can easily convert them into an American format with an <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/tools/odds-converter/">online odds calculator</a>.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>How do baseball odds work?</strong></h3><div>Sportsbooks calculate the probability of a team winning a game, covering a run line, winning the World Series and so on, and then devise <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/">betting odds</a>.

It simply involves predicting who will win the fight. The oddsmakers at each sportsbook site will delve into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each fighter, focusing on things like power, striking ability, athleticism, grappling prowess, clinch fighting, age, experience and so on, plus the record of each fighter. They will then release odds on each one winning.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{cb0a650d-1044-4e5b-8e1d-7cb3ed78ea57}{178}\" paraid=\"591079746\"\u003EAs an example, in May 2019, Michael Chandler opened as the -265 favorite to beat Patricio Freire at Bellator 221, while Pitbull was the +185 underdog. When the Bellator MMA odds start with a minus sign, it tells you the amount of money you would need to wager in order to earn a $100 profit. A $265 bet on Chandler at -265 would have netted you a $100 profit. You get your stake back on winning bets, so you would have been returned $365 if successful.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{cb0a650d-1044-4e5b-8e1d-7cb3ed78ea57}{182}\" paraid=\"2105181494\"\u003EA plus sign at the start of Bellator odds tells you the profit you stand to make from a $100 wager.

The famous sportsbooks in the city employ intelligent, experienced, and highly paid oddsmakers to assess both fighters and devise odds on the outcome. They always factor in a house edge. If one fighter is a popular choice among the betting public, the odds on him will become less attractive, and the odds on his opponent will become more attractive. This helps the books balance their risk. &nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EThe oddsmakers can take advantage of historical trends and algorithms to help them with their projections, and most bettors do not study the card in the same detail, so it can be difficult to beat the books.

For example, if Daniel Dubois is -400 to beat Joe Joyce, you know that you will need to lay down $400 in order to win $100. Your stake is always returned if your bet wins, so you would get $500 back. If Joyce is +275, it tells you that a $100 bet on him would earn you a $275 profit. The boxer with negative odds is the favorite, and the boxer with odds beginning with a plus is the underdog.

It&#39;s a sizable mismatch and the odds show the point spread at Chiefs -11. In this example, we will exaggerate the percentages and the amounts to make our point. Let&#39;s assume the betting public has 90 wagers on Kansas City and only 10 bets on New York. This would indicate that the NFL consensus is 90% KC and 10% Jets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, let&#39;s also assume that the amount wagered shows the Jets with 70 percent of the money on them versus only 30 percent on the Chiefs. This would indicate that the small money bets were on KC but the big money wagers were placed on New York. The NFL public money is squarely on the big favorite but the sharps are jumping on that inflated line and betting Gang Green at what they consider good value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what the NFL football consensus provides our readers and it shows that the public consensus can be a very effective tool.

Sportsbook Review is an industry watchdog that assigns letter grades ranging from A+ to F so that our readers will be able to determine the elite, the good, the average, and the truly predatory. The NFL public betting picks are gathered through our readers clicking on their site of choice featuring the best odds on the team they wish to bet on and these stats show up anonymously on our site.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe even have forums devoted to free NFL consensus picks so that our readers can see the public betting money and the wise guy action. But all of these consensus picks are derived from the best books in the industry and are all A+ and A rated books. Those new to SBR should know that all of the online sportsbooks are constantly monitored and these ratings are by no means static. Average books can prove themselves to be graded as good while good books can be graded as elite if they can deliver an exceptional level of customer service and satisfaction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sportsbookreview.com\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eonline sportsbooks\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that appear on our pages, whether it is NFL consensus picks Week 1 or the entire 2021 NFL consensus picks, are all among the most trusted and respected in the business. The NFL season is long and it is even longer this season as the teams will be playing 17 regular-season games versus 16, plus the playoffs and eventually the Super Bowl.

The most critical element is that the customer gets paid in a timely fashion when requesting a payout. That is the holy grail in the sports betting business because if your payment is delayed or not paid at all, what is the sense in even betting with that book? Even the mid-range books pay but there are nefarious, black-listed, F-rated, books that don&#39;t pay...ever. That&#39;s why it is so important to read the sportsbook rating guide.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmong the common denominators of these elite books are the many ways to fund an account including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They make depositing a breeze and getting paid is equally as seamless. The NFL public consensus and NFL moneyline consensus that you see are derived from these books and others that meet SBR&#39;s lofty expectations. The odds will differ at times at many of these books but that is why it is always best to have multiple accounts to ensure that you get the best odds or point spreads available.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd once you fund your account you should know that the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sportsbookreview.com\u002Fbest-sportsbooks\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ebest online sportsbooks\u003C\u002Fa\u003E provide outstanding customer service, a plethora of betting options, easy to navigate dashboard, state-of-the-art mobile platforms, excellent bonuses, and unique betting props, particularly during the Super Bowl.

A $165 bet on Sevilla at -165 would earn you a $100 profit.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{ffc5a344-8e83-445b-8477-a181d98c1876}{191}\" paraid=\"1180309406\"\u003EA plus sign tells you the profit you would earn from a $100 bet. A $100 bet on AEK at +300 would earn you a $300 profit if successful. Bettors receive their stake back on winning bets, so your return would be $400. The larger potential payout on AEK tells you that it is the clear underdog in this hypothetical game.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{ffc5a344-8e83-445b-8477-a181d98c1876}{195}\" paraid=\"1358084330\"\u003EThe odds move about in the buildup to a game.

The Europa League group stage throws up a number of mismatches.

That would mean a $20 bet would only net you a $5 profit if successful. If that is unappealing, you could check out the handicap spread instead. In that case, you might find Arsenal as the&nbsp;-1.5 goal&nbsp;favorite, and you could back Arsenal -1.5 at odds of around -110.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{ffc5a344-8e83-445b-8477-a181d98c1876}{211}\" paraid=\"384726167\"\u003EThe Gunners would have to win by 2 or more goals in order for your bet to pay off. That makes it a harder bet to succeed with, but you would be rewarded with a significantly higher profit if you can pull it off. You can alternatively bet on Poznan +1.5, and it could either win the match, battle to a draw or lose by 1 goal and your bet would be a winner.

American odds start with either a minus sign or a plus sign. If it starts with a minus sign, that tells you the amount you need to wager in order to generate a $100 profit. For example, if Philadelphia Union is -140 to beat San Jose Earthquakes, you would need to wager $140 on Philadelphia Union in order to earn a $100 profit.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{36ae33f7-a140-4566-90a7-6b5c9d0986c8}{180}\" paraid=\"858283389\"\u003EYou are not obliged to wager $140 on Philadelphia. That is merely a guide. You could wager $20 and you would earn a $14.29 profit if the Union won the game, or you could wager $10,000 and make a $7,142.86 profit.

Decimal odds help you work out the return you stand to make on a successful bet. Let&rsquo;s say Seattle Sounders FC is priced at 1.77 to beat Minnesota Utd in the MLS betting odds. You then simply multiply that figure by your stake to calculate your potential return if your bet pays off.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{36ae33f7-a140-4566-90a7-6b5c9d0986c8}{200}\" paraid=\"573919097\"\u003EIf you bet $10 at 1.77 and Seattle wins the game, your return would be $17.70. That includes a $7.70 profit and the return of your $10 stake. That is the main difference between US odds and decimal odds: US odds tell you the profit you stand to earn, whereas decimal odds tell you the amount you will be paid (profit plus return of stake).&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{36ae33f7-a140-4566-90a7-6b5c9d0986c8}{204}\" paraid=\"1999554656\"\u003EAs another example of decimal odds, you might see Los Angeles FC at 2.35 to beat Columbus Crew. If you bet $100 on Los Angeles FC and it won the game, you would be returned $235 (a $135 profit and the return of your $100 stake).

A&nbsp;moneyline&nbsp;bet is a straightforward wager on the result of a particular game. You might bet on Minnesota United FC to beat FC Dallas, or Colorado Rapids to draw with Montreal Impact. The soccer odds compilers at the soccer betting sites will assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of both&nbsp;teams, and&nbsp;assign a set of odds to each potential outcome: home win, draw and away win.

It gives the supposedly stronger soccer team a handicap in order to skew the odds. For instance, let&rsquo;s say LA Galaxy is the -280 favorite to beat New England Revolution, and New England Revolution is the +775 underdog for anyone looking at&nbsp;moneyline&nbsp;bets. If you wanted more value on LA Galaxy, you could check out the point spread. You might expect to find odds of -110 on the Galaxy -1.5, which means they would have to win the game by two or more goals for your bet to pay off.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{36ae33f7-a140-4566-90a7-6b5c9d0986c8}{233}\" paraid=\"166871151\"\u003EThat obviously makes success more difficult, but your rewards are significantly greater. A $100 bet would earn a profit of $91 at -110, as opposed to $35.71 at -280. Alternatively, you could bet on the Revolution +1.5, meaning they could either win, draw or lose by a single goal&nbsp;in order for&nbsp;your bet to be successful.

Let&rsquo;s say the LA Lakers are on a long winning run and preparing to host the Oklahoma City Thunder at Staples Center. You might see odds of -187 on the Lakers and +161 on OKC in the NBA opening lines at top sites like Circa Sports. A&nbsp;\u003Cstrong\u003Eminus sign\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E at the start of basketball lines tells you the amount you need to wager in order to earn a $100 profit.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIn this case, a $187 bet on the Lakers would earn you a $100 profit if they won the game. A $20 bet on the Lakers would net you $10.70, whereas a $20 bet on OKC would net you $32.20.

If we stick with the example used above, you might expect to see the Lakers are the 4.5-point favorites. You could then opt for either the Lakers -4.5 or the Thunder +4.5 in the NBA point spread. Sportsbooks generally offer -110 on either outcome, but some will go to -105 if they offer reduced juice NBA spreads.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIf you back the Lakers to cover the spread, they must win by 5 or more points. If they win by just 4 points, your bet is a loser. While this is harder to achieve, you will earn a considerably higher profit than if you had bet the moneyline. If you bet on the Thunder to cover the spread, OKC would simply have to get within 4 points of the Lakers. The Thunder could therefore either win the game or lose by 4 or fewer points, and your bet would be a winner, but your payout would be smaller than if you had bet the moneyline.\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENBA Totals Betting\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is another hugely popular basketball wager.

In 2019, Duke was the +320 favorite to win the NCAAB men&rsquo;s tournament, followed by Gonzaga at +500 and North Carolina at +600, while Texas Tech was a popular pick at +2000. Teams including Bradley and Gardner-Webb were complete outsiders at +5000. In 2020, Kansas was the +450 favorite to win the tournament, followed by Gonzaga and Baylor at +800, and West Virginia was a popular long shot pick, but the tournament was cancelled due to Covid-19. Gonzaga, Virginia and Villanova were the early favorites to win March Madness in 2021.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIf you see a plus sign in college betting, it tells you the profit you stand to win from a $100 stake. A $100 bet on Duke in 2019 would have earned you $320 if successful, whereas a $100 bet on Bradley would have netted you $5,000. In the end, +800 shot Virginia won the tournament. You do not have to bet $100. A $10 bet at odds of +800 would have netted you an $80 profit. You also get your stake back if your bet is successful, so you would have enjoyed a return of $90. If you had bet $500 on Virginia at +800, you would have made a $4,000 profit and been handed a return of $4,500. The futures prices change as the tournament progresses: by the time the final four odds were released in 2019, the college basketball line on Virginia winning the tournament had decreased significantly as it was one of the few teams still standing. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECollege Basketball Moneyline Betting\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a simple wager on which team will win the game. Sportsbooks weigh up the relative strengths of each team before assigning NCAAB odds on each of them. If Duke is due to play North Carolina State, you might see a moneyline price of -300 on Duke and +250 on North Carolina. A minus sign tells you how much you need to wager in order to make a $100 profit. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIn this instance, you would need to bet $300 on Duke to make a $100 profit. A $10 bet on Duke would earn you $3.33 if successful, whereas a $10 bet on North Carolina would earn you $25. That tells you the sportsbooks think Duke has a much better chance to win the game, so it is the clear favorite in the college basketball odds, while North Carolina is the underdog for the game. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECollege Basketball Spreads\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point spread is the most common way to bet on college basketball. The sportsbooks will give the supposedly stronger team a handicap in order to make things even. You might see Duke installed as the 8.5-point favorite in the March Madness lines for that hypothetical game against North Carolina. You would then be able to bet either on Duke -8.5 or N.C. State +8.5 in point spread. You would generally expect to find odds of -110 on either team to cover the spread, unless you find a reduced juice book that takes lower vigorish and offers -105 lines on each team. &nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIf you bet on Duke to cover the spread, it would need to win by 9 or more points. However, you would be likely to find odds of -110 as opposed to -300, so your potential profit would be much higher. If you bet on N.C. State to cover that spread, it could either win the game or lose by no more than 8 points and your bet would pay off. However, you would be likely to find odds of -110 as opposed to +250, so your payout would be smaller.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EYou can also find a number of alternative point spread options at some of the best betting sites. If the official line was 8.5 points, a betting site might offer you the opportunity to bet on an alternative point spread line of 7.5, 6.5, 9.5 or 10.5. If you thought Duke would win convincingly, you could bet on Duke -10.5 to get better odds. If you thought N.C. State might struggle to cover an 8.5-point spread, but that it would get close, you could bet on N.C. State +9.5 and accept slightly less attractive odds. You could alternatively get better odds by going for N.C. State +6.5 to cover the spread. This point spread flexibility is only available at a few sportsbooks, but it can be really helpful. Other books allow you to buy or sell points or half-points to skew the spread in different directions, and that is a similar concept. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECollege Basketball Totals Betting\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESportsbooks will set college basketball lines relating to the total points that will be scored in a particular game. An example would be 144.5 points in a game between Wake Forest and Pac 12 heavyweights Oregon. You then have to predict whether the cumulative points scored by both teams will go over or under that line. Once again, you will typically see -110 on either outcome, unless it offers reduced juice NCAA Basketball odds. Some of the best sportsbooks will also allow you to bet on team totals. You might be able to bet on over or under 77.5 points for Oregon, as an example. Oregon would not have to win the game for your bet to pay off. It would simply need to score more than 77.5 points.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECollege Basketball Prop Bets\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome bettors want to go deeper than spreads and totals when looking for the perfect NCAA Basketball lines to bet on. Sportsbooks cater to those bettors by offering a range of exotic prop bets on college basketball games.

The sportsbooks will analyze both teams and then release moneyline odds on the likelihood of each team winning. You will generally see a favorite and an underdog when looking at the NFL latest line. For example, you might see the New Orleans Saints priced at -278 in the NFL betting lines for their game against Atlanta, with the Falcons as the +220 underdogs. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIf you see a minus symbol, it tells you the amount you need to wager in order to win $100. A $278 bet at -278 would earn you a $100 profit if successful. In this instance, a $20 bet on New Orleans would net you $7.19 if it won, whereas a $20 bet on Atlanta would earn you a $44 profit.

If a flurry of bets were to be placed on the Falcons, the odds would drop on Atlanta winning the game. That is because the sportsbooks like to spread their risk, so they will offer customers an incentive to bet upon the other team. Sharp bettors like to capitalize on these line moves. The odds would also change if, for example, the New Orleans starting quarterback were to suffer an injury in midweek. For that reason, the NFL odds on games today often look different to the odds released at the start of the week. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENFL Point Spreads\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is the most popular way to bet on football. The NFL odds compilers will give the supposedly stronger team a points handicap in order to even things up. If we stick with the above example, you would expect to see the Saints as 6.5-point favorites in the football spread betting lines. That means you could bet on either New Orleans -6.5 or Atlanta +6.5. The NFL odds on each outcome would be -110, or they could be as generous as -105 if you bet with a sportsbook that offers reduced juice on NFL.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIf you bet on the Saints, they would need to win by seven or more points in order for your bet to pay off. You would then earn a significantly higher profit than if you had bet the moneyline. If you were to bet on the Falcons, your bet would be successful if they either won the game or lost by no more than 6 points. You would earn a smaller profit than if you bet on the moneyline, but you would have a better chance of winning. &nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EMany \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sportsbookreview.com\u002Fbest-sportsbooks\u002F\"\u003Esportsbooks\u003C\u002Fa\u003E wait for the Las Vegas football odds before releasing their NFL bet lines, but some set early lines themselves, particularly when it comes to NFL playoff spreads and the Super Bowl point spread. The Super Bowl is one of the biggest wagering events of the year, and Week 1 is also exceptionally popular after the long off-season, so you will find really competitive odds on those games.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E&nbsp;You should also be able to find alternative point spreads on various NFL game today action. For example, let&#39;s say the Las Vegas Raiders are playing against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Las vegas is the 1.5-point favorite, with odds of -110 on Las Vegas -1.5 and -110 on Tampa Bay +1.5. Some sites that offer betting on today game NFL markets will offer an alternative line, which skews the odds in different directions.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EYou might believe that the Raiders will win the game comfortably. You could then bet on Las Vegas -2.5 or Las Vegas -3.5 and receive more attractive odds. You might alternatively think that the Bucs will come close, but you aren&#39;t quite comfortable with a 1.5-point line. You might then be able to bet on Tampa Bay +2.5 instead of Tampa Bay +1.5. You would not receive such good odds, but your wager would stand a better chance of paying off. Many sportsbooks also allow you to buy or sell half points or full points on spreads, which is a similar prospect.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENFL Totals\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is another really popular \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sportsbookreview.com\u002Fnfl\u002F\"\u003ENFL\u003C\u002Fa\u003E bet line. Many bettors like these lines on an NFL today game, because you are not required to predict which team will win or cover the point spread.

That is why this bet is often referred to as an NFL over under wager. It might be 48.5 points, and you can typically find -110 on over and -110 on under. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EThe result is determined by adding the home team&rsquo;s score and the away team&rsquo;s score. Just like with the point spread, NFL totals lines will change in the build-up to a game depending on how popular each option is among bettors.

Over the last 40 plus years, the standard NFL season has had four preseason and 16 regular-season games. Therefore, when looking at past performance it is easy to assume that a team will be within a few games of what they did last year. But this year the NFL has made a seismic shift in the schedule and now has three preseason games and 17 regular-season contests.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat&#39;s a big deal especially when many bettors will be viewing these NFL win total futures and subconsciously believe they are all a bit high. Well, of course, they are a bit high because there is one more game added to the schedule which means one more potential win on a team&#39;s record. Forgetting this is a simple mistake and one that many will dismiss but it is a potential landmine if you don&#39;t consider the new schedule and the one additional game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the NFL future odds win totals will be askew but we will endeavor to make sure we consider the future schedules NFL and examine each teams&#39; strength of schedule when evaluating whether there is any value in the over or under for a particular team. Our NFL future bets total wins demand that we scrutinize not only the schedules but the rosters of each team as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will be many changes with injuries, retirements, free agency signings, and the addition of those players expected to make an impact via the NFL Draft. The NFL future schedules and NFL future power rankings are two key tools to use in your evaluation of whether there is value in an over or under wager on a particular team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we leave this topic, let&#39;s talk about what an \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sportsbookreview.com\u002Fbetting-odds\u002Fnfl-football\u002Ffutures\u002F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ENFL futures\u003C\u002Fa\u003E bet looks like, vis a vis season wins.

These numbers are based on $100 bets so whenever you see a minus sign you know that the number to the right of it represents how much money you need to risk in order to win $100.

On the flipside, subtract 6.5 points from the Steelers&rsquo; final score, and if their total points are higher than their opponents, you&rsquo;ve cashed a winning ticket.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENFL SU Standings&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NFL standings SU column provides the conference record for each NFL team, but different from the ATS record, it shows a team&rsquo;s straight up results (SU) without a point margin (spread) included. It doesn&rsquo;t become any more simple than understanding a SU record, and if the Buffalo Bills have won twelve games and lost three, their SU record would be 12-3.&nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should highlight that teams with the best SU records aren&rsquo;t necessarily the ideal teams to wager against the spread. Positive SU records represent a moneyline wager, and although successful in winning the game, they can still lose against the spread.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is an NFL SU\u002FMoneyline Wager?&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA moneyline wager is the most simplistic of all bet types. You are simply deciding on which team is going to win. However, as mentioned, the best teams with impressive SU records don&#39;t always provide a favorable long-term winning percentage against the spread.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen viewing the NFL league standings, remember to research the straight up (SU) record to know a team&#39;s moneyline value. A team can win ten games (10-0) and still lose each game against the spread (0-10).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENFL O\u002FU\u002FP Standings&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe O\u002FU\u002FP column on our NFL standings page represents Over\u002FUnder\u002FPush. These records are obtained through the number of times a team has covered the sportsbook&rsquo;s total number of points scored during a game. A game winner or loser is eradicated, as all that matters to an Over\u002FUnder bettor is the number of points scored in the games they&#39;ve wagered on.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBettors aim to predict whether the points scored will exceed or fall below the total number set by the bookmakers. If the Kansas City Chiefs have exceeded the total points scored nine times but gone under the total set by sportsbooks five times, their totals record would be 9-5. In addition, a total can push if the number wagered on is a round total. In the same example, if the Chiefs and their opponent&rsquo;s total were set at 40, 50 &amp; 60 across three games and the final score amounted to 40, 50 and 60 &ndash; these totals would be known as a &quot;push&quot;. The Chiefs O\u002FU\u002FP record would then show as 9-5-3.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUnderstanding NFL Totals&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if the Steelers vs Browns game has an Over\u002FUnder number set to 55.5 and the final score was 40-17, wagering on the over would be a successful bet. 40+17= 57, a number greater than 55.5. If the final score showed 37-17, bettors who&#39;d wagered on the under would win because a total of 54 is lower than the bookmakers set a total of 55.5.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;Like wagering against the spread, many of the same principles can be applied in betting on totals. Studying the offensive and defensive statistics should be a crucial aspect of a handicapper&rsquo;s routine; owning the best insight into the games you&rsquo;re looking to wager can determine if a game will be a high or low-scoring affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the NFL standings right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESportsbook Review NFL standings are regularly updated and, in most cases, will be altered as the games take place.

You will generally see a favorite and an underdog in NHL games tonight.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIf the Philadelphia Flyers are hosting the Carolina Hurricanes for a regular season game, you might find the Flyers installed as the -150 NHL favorites and the Hurricanes as the +120 underdogs in the hockey odds. A minus sign tells you the amount you must wager in order to win $100. In this instance you would need to bet $150 to win $100 on the Flyers.&nbsp;A plus symbol tells you the amount you would win from a successful $100 wager. In this example, you would win $120 from a $100 bet on the Hurricanes.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EYou can then choose the amount you would like to wager. A $20 bet on the Flyers would earn you a $13.33 profit if successful, whereas a $20 bet on the Hurricanes winning the game would earn you a $24 profit at those NHL odds. The larger potential profit on the Hurricanes tells you that they are the underdogs for the game. The sportsbooks think they have a lower chance of winning the game than the Flyers, so they offer more attractive odds in order to tempt bettors. However, hockey odds can move. If the vast majority of bettors wagered on the Hurricanes, the price on them would grow less attractive and the price on Philadelphia would grow more attractive in the NHL latest lines.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENHL Puck Lines\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an intriguing NHL point spread wager that skews the odds. The sportsbooks will give the stronger team a handicap of 1.5 goals. Sticking with the example used above, you would be able to bet on Philadelphia -1.5 in the hockey lines. The Flyers would then have to win by 2 or more goals in order for your bet to pay off. This is known as covering the point spread, even though we talk about goals as opposed to points in hockey.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIf the Flyers only won by a single goal, your puck line bet would not pay out. However, you would expect to receive +200, resulting in a much higher payout if they pulled it off. Your alternative would be to bet on Carolina +1.5 in the NHL betting lines. The Hurricanes could then win the game, or lose by a single goal, and your bet would pay off. Yet you would expect NHL odds of -250 instead of the +120 that you would receive on the moneyline, so your potential payout is smaller. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EPuck lines are a great option if you think that a favorite will secure a resounding victory. The puck line offers you much more value than betting on the moneyline. NHL fans often use these NHL spreads if they think an underdog will win a game but are worried that it might suffer a narrow defeat. You can also check out correct score betting for even more value, and there are all manner of prop bets and futures wagers available on hockey. Sportsbooks also offer live NHL odds once the games start.

It is also referred to as an NHL over under bet, as those are your two options. It is a great choice if you are unsure about which team will win a game, but you feel it will either be a low-scoring clash or a high-scoring game.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EWhen the Tampa Bay Lightning, last season&rsquo;s Eastern Conference winners, played against the Dallas Stars, the Western Conference champions, in Game 1 of the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals, a sportsbook might have offered -110 on over 5.5 goals and -110 on under 5.5 goals. If you had bet on under 5.5 goals, your wager would have been successful, as the Stars beat the Eastern Conference champions 4-1, although the Lightning ended up winning the Stanley Cup. A $10 wager at -110 would have earned you a $9.10 profit. You get your stake back when your bet is a winner.

Top sports betting sites like Caesars will provide an abundance of prop bets on a big NHL game. You might like to bet on whether a particular player will have over 1.5 shots or under 1.5 shots over the course of the game. If it is a key player, you might find odds of -156 on over 1.5 or +120 on under 1.5. You can also bet on over or under on the total saves each goaltender will make during the game.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EGood sportsbooks will offer NHL odds on total assists for important players. You might also be able to bet on a player scoring at least one goal, two goals or three goals, scoring at least a certain amount of points or on a goaltender making at least a certain number of saves. You can sometimes find customizable single player statistic betting, or compile head-to-head statistics wagers between two particular players in a game.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EYou will also be able to find team props. Predicting which team will score first is a popular market among pro hockey bettors. Draw no bet and double chance are alternative options that protect you in the event that the game is tied. You can bet on first goalscorer and anytime goalscorer, or opt for correct score betting to get more value. You will earn far higher odds on the Dallas Stars winning 3-2 than on the Stars simply winning a game. You can also break it down into specific periods, betting on the team that will prevail in each period and the number of goals that will be scored. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENHL Futures Betting &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EThe sportsbooks will release odds on each team winning the Stanley Cup at the start of the season. This is known as a futures bet, as it will not be settled for a long time. The betting market starts with a favorite, deemed by the odds compilers to be the strongest team. The odds then grow progressively longer on each team until you reach the rank outsider. That huge underdog is given no chance of securing success, although the Vegas Golden Knights almost defied odds of 500\u002F1 (+50000) to win the Stanley Cup in their first season (2017-18). &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EYou can also place futures wagers on each team winning its division or conference. The odds on these teams change as the season progresses. If one team is on fire, you can expect the odds on it to drop. If a team is struggling, or if its star player suffers a bad injury, the odds are likely to grow longer. You can bet on futures markets at different times of the season, seize upon changes to the odds and end up securing a guaranteed profit by betting on several different teams if you are sharp enough. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003ENHL futures are also possible on individual player markets.

You should also be able to bet over or under on the total wins each NHL team will secure during the regular season.

Odds compilers will weigh up the relative strengths and weaknesses of each team, factoring in head-to-head records, injuries, fatigue, motivation levels, home advantage and so on. They will then assign a set of sports betting odds to each team. There is typically a favorite and an underdog.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003ELet&rsquo;s say the Eagles are having a strong season and the Jets are struggling. You might see the Eagles priced at -770 to win the game at Lincoln Financial Field, with the Jets as +540 underdogs in the moneyline odds. If you see a \u003Cstrong\u003Eminus sign before a set of odds\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, it tells you how much you need to stake in order to earn a $100 profit.

A $100 bet on the Jets at +540 would net you $540 if they pulled off an upset, indicating that they are the clear underdogs. You will sometimes see +540 rendered as 6.40 (decimal odds), but you can use a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sportsbookreview.com\u002Fpicks\u002Ftools\u002Fodds-converter\u002F\"\u003Ebetting odds calculator\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to turn it into American odds.\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EPoint Spread\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003ESpread gambling is the most popular form of wagering on football, basketball and many other sports.

Sticking with the example above, you might expect to see the NFL point spreads set at 13.5, with odds of -110 on the Eagles -13.5, and odds of -110 on the Jets +13.5.

You would need to bet $100 just to win $10 at those UFC card odds, and that is not attractive for many bettors. You could earn a more appealing set of UFC fight night odds on him by specifying how he would win the fight. Your options are \u003Cstrong\u003Eknockout, submission, or decision\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. If you opt for knockout and he wins via a decision, your bet does not pay out. It is therefore harder to pull off a method of victory wager than a simply moneyline bet, but you will be rewarded with a higher profit if your prediction proves to be correct.\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUFC Total Round Betting\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou will often see total round betting when browsing current UFC odds. This is a prediction on \u003Cstrong\u003Ehow long the fight will last\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. The sportsbooks that allow you to bet on UFC tonight will weigh up the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two fighters. They will judge how evenly matched the combatants are and look into how regularly their fights go the distance. They will then assign a different set of odds to each outcome.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EYou might find betting on \u003Cstrong\u003Eover or under\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E 1.5 rounds of 2.5 rounds, for instance. If you think it will be a short fight, bet on under. If you think it will be a long, drawn out battle, you can bet on over. Many sportsbooks that offer coverage of UFC fights tonight will also provide live betting, allowing you to wager on the action while it develops. These prices will shift as the fight goes on.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003ESome books will allow you to bet on the specific round in which the fight will end. You can also gain more value by combining round betting with method of victory betting. For instance, you will gain more value by betting on Ferguson to win via a second-round submission than by simply betting on Ferguson to win via a submission. You can also find bets on whether the fight will go the distance at some sportsbooks that provide UFC fight lines.\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUFC Prop Bets\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA prop bet is a \u003Cstrong\u003Especial wager\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E that does not necessarily relate to the outcome of a particular fight.

This is a great way to gain more value when you like the look of a few UFC favorites. Let&rsquo;s say you think Jorge Masvidal, Darren Till, and Stephen Thompson will all win on the same night. You could split your money into three and bet on each fighter individually. Alternatively, you could \u003Cstrong\u003Ecombine them for a single parlay\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EAll three would \u003Cstrong\u003Ehave to win their fights\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E for your parlay to pay out.

You might see the Washington Mystics priced as the -135 favorite to win a home game against the Los Angeles Sparks, and the Sparks named the +115 underdog. If you see a minus sign at the start of a set of odds, it tells you the amount you need to wager in order to make a $100 profit. A $135 bet on the Sparks at -135 would net you $100.

A $100 bet at +115 would earn you a $115 profit, and your return would be $215. In this case, a $20 bet on the Mystics at -135 would earn you winnings of $14.81, whereas a $20 bet on the Sparks at +115 would earn you $23.

It involves giving the supposedly stronger team a handicap to level things out. Let&rsquo;s say that for some reason the Seattle Storm is the -423 favorite to beat the Las Vegas Aces, and Las Vegas is the +333 underdog for the matchup.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{981a799e-92b4-4efc-8d4d-7959e5179ae7}{204}\" paraid=\"552551421\"\u003ESomeone could bet on Seattle to cover the moneyline, but a $20 bet at -423 would only net you a $4.73 profit if successful. If you find that unappealing, you can check out the point spread instead. In this instance, you would expect to find the line set at 9.5 points. You could then bet on the Las Vegas -9.5. Las Vegas would need to win the game by 10 or more points in order for your bet to pay off, but you would expect to enjoy odds of -110 or -105 as opposed to -423, resulting in a much higher potential payout.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{981a799e-92b4-4efc-8d4d-7959e5179ae7}{208}\" paraid=\"1717460453\"\u003EYou could alternatively bet on the Storm +9.5, and again the odds would be around -110. Seattle could then win the game or lose by up to 9 points and your bet would pay out.

You do not have to specify the result. You might find the game totals line set at 155.5 in a game between Connecticut Sun and Chicago Sky. If you bet on unders, it could finish 100-55 to Connecticut or 76-74 to Chicago and you would&nbsp;get&nbsp;paid out either way.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{981a799e-92b4-4efc-8d4d-7959e5179ae7}{224}\" paraid=\"387231863\"\u003EYou typically find betting odds of around -110 on overs and unders when betting on totals, but sometimes those odds differ. Totals betting is helpful if you are unsure which team will win a game, but you think it will be a high-scoring clash or a low-scoring contest. Some sports betting sites allow you to combine bets for a same game parlay. You might then be able to bet on Atlanta Dream to cover the spread and under 152 points in a game, for example.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ch2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{981a799e-92b4-4efc-8d4d-7959e5179ae7}{228}\" paraid=\"564725305\" role=\"heading\"\u003EOther Bets&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp paraeid=\"{981a799e-92b4-4efc-8d4d-7959e5179ae7}{232}\" paraid=\"2123204322\"\u003EThe&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sportsbookreview.com\u002Fbest-sportsbooks\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Etop sportsbooks\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&nbsp;provide a range of WNBA bets to choose from.

However, Andreescu went on to win the match, showing that outsiders often prevail.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EYou might also see odds rendered in \u003Cstrong\u003Efractional\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E or \u003Cstrong\u003Edecimal format\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Sticking with the womens tennis final example from 2019, odds of +220 would become 11\u002F5 in fractional format. The number on the left of the slash represents the profit you make by wagering the amount on the right. A $5 bet at 11\u002F5 would therefore earn you a profit of $11.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EYou get your stake back when your bet is a winner. Decimal odds take that into account. WTA US Open odds of +220 therefore become 3.20 in decimal format. You multiply your stake by that figure to calculate your potential return if successful. A $20 bet at 3.20 therefore earns you a $64 return ($44 profit and your $20 stake back).\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETennis Betting Options\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETennis betting can be broadly grouped into two categories: futures and match bets. \u003Cstrong\u003EFutures wagers\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E relate to long-term events, such as the winner of the WTAUS Open or the Fed Cup. The sportsbooks will analyze the relative strengths of all the players taking part in the US Open before releasing US Open tennis odds. These WTA tennis odds will start with a favorite &ndash; generally Serena Williams, Bianca Andreescu, Ashleigh Barty, Simona Halep or Naomi Osaka &ndash; and the odds will grow progressively longer until you reach the rank outsiders.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EWhen it comes to WTA tennis matches, the sportsbooks will judge the strengths of the two women competing. They will then release women&#39;s tennis odds on a range of markets. The most common option is betting on the winner of the match, but you can also opt for \u003Cstrong\u003Espread betting\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. For example, if you wanted more value when looking at the US Open tennis betting odds in 2019, you could have bet on Serena Williams -3.5. She would have had to win by 4 clear games &ndash; so 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 would not have paid out &ndash; but you would have received odds of -120 as opposed to -275.&nbsp;\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIf you are unsure who will win a particular US women&rsquo;s tennis match, but you feel like it will either end quickly or turn into a long, drawn-out affair, you can opt for \u003Cstrong\u003Etotals betting\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. The sportsbooks will set a line &ndash; for example, 21.5 games &ndash; and you simply have to decide whether the total games played in the match will go over that line or stay under it. You can also find \u003Cstrong\u003Eprop bets\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E on WTA matches, including the number of aces served in a match, or you can roll multiple bets together into a parlay in a bid to earn a greater profit.\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFind a Great Sportsbook for Tennis Bets\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWomen&rsquo;s Tennis Association betting is very popular, and hundreds of sportsbooks offer odds on the action.
